### labware-library tasks

This directory's Makefile has the following set of labware-library specific development tasks defined.

```shell
# default task: build production artifacts
# these three commands are identical
make -C labware-library
make -C labware-library all
make -C labware-library clean dist

# start a hot-reloading development server
# (optional) specify port with PORT; default is 5173
make -C labware-library dev
make -C labware-library dev PORT=8081

# build production assets and serve them

make -C labware-library serve PORT=9091
```

### vite setup

This project (along with our other front-end projects) uses [vite][] to generate artifacts.

- Entry point is [`labware-library/src/index.tsx`][entry]
- [Handlebars][] HTML template is [`labware-library/src/index.hbs`][template]
  - Post-build, the site is crawled and prerendered with [react-snap][]
- Global CSS is [`labware-library/src/global.module.css`][global-style]
  - All other CSS is used via [CSS Modules][]
- All artifacts will be output to `labware-library/dist`

### environment variables

Certain environment variables, when set, will affect the artifact output.

| variable              | value                                | description                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| NODE_ENV              | production, development, test        | Optimizes output for a specific environment               |
| OT_LL_MIXPANEL_ID     | some string ID                       | Mixpanel token for prod environment.                      |
| OT_LL_MIXPANEL_DEV_ID | some string ID                       | Mixpanel token for dev environment.                       |
| OT_LL_VERSION         | semver string eg "1.2.3"             | reported to analytics. Read from package.json by default. |
